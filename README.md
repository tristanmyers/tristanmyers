Hello, I'm an electrical engineering student who is a self taught software engineer. Feel free to check out my pinned repos.

I've focused on web development for 3+ years. I'm interested in native software development, server development, and game development.

I'm also interested in hardware engineering and will eventually dive into that.

### Technologies I'm familar with
Javascript, Typescript, Python, C, Node, Deno, Bun, React, Svelte, GraphQL, SQLite, GIT, Shopify, Figma

### What I'm working on
- Teessandbox, a place for my creations to live.
- [Homepage](https://github.com/tristanmyers/homepage-svelte), Any information I want to see regularly will live here. In theory this should keep
me away from social media or at the least decrease my use of socials. It will allow me to aggregate
anything I am interested in into one place; somewhere I control. While keeping me up to date with
what is going on with the internet and the world.
Currently being rewritten to svelte from a server side generated webpage written in typescript.
